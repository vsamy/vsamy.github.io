      title: Haptic covers for humanoid and safe human aware falling strategies
      text: > 
              PhD. thesis in humanoid robotics at the IDH team, Lirmm.
              This work aims to reduce damages taken by humanoid robots when a fall occurs
              This is done in two main steps. The robot is controlled during the fall (to prepare the impact), 
              then an adaptive control is used to comply to the impact.

      title: QP-based Adaptive-Gains Compliance Control in Humanoid Falls
      text: >
              Submitted to the conference ICRA in 2017. This work gives a method for handling safe complex falls.
              The control cqn hqndle a fall in a cluttered environment with front, back and side fall.
              To comply to the impact an adaptive controller that can tune motor's gains has been developed.

      title: Falls control using posture reshaping and active compliance
      text: >
              Submitted to the conference humanoids in 2015.
              The works gives a simple method that can handle front and back fall and the postures in which the robot should not be when impacting the ground.
