# Welcome!
I made this website to present a part of my work and myself.
All that is presented here is in free access so anyone can get interest in, or used what i have done. Enjoy;

## Short presentation
I am Vincent Samy, a current PhD. student at LIRMM<sup><a href="#ft1">1</a></sup> , Montpellier, France.
I work on safe falls for humanoid robots, or 'how to control the robot so that it does smack into the ground too hard'.
As a fall is a relatively fast event (<1s), i have made a point of honor to develop an on-line algorithm.
The main contribution of my thesis is, without doubt, the adaptive qp that enables to tune the motor's PD-gains on-line in order to comply to the impact.

## Research outputs
Through my different experience, i have been working on diverse subject.
From the manipulability of hybrid actuator to humanoids control and more particulary, safe falls. I have worked in laboratories like the complex mechanical system engineering laboratory at Kobe university<sup><a href="#ft2">2</a></sup>, Japan, the LIST<sup><a href="#ft3">3</a></sup> at the CEA<sup><a href="#ft4">4</a></sup>, France, The ISIR<sup><a href="#ft5">5</a></sup> of the Pierre et Marie Curry university, France, and lastly, the Lirmm.
... Show sexy pictures. Pousser le robot a été jouissif :)

## Github repository
Through the years i have developed different tool to help me for my PhD. but also for fun.
I drop on my github repository all libraries I can upload freely.
... 2 pictures for work, for fun.
